# kinesis-programmer-dvorak
A keyboard layout so I can use the keyboard programmed dvorak on the kinesis, with progammer dvorak programmed for the symbol and number keys


The problem I have is using programmer dvorak, some programs aren't honoring the keyboard shortcuts with dvorak layout.

The preference is to use the standard US layout with dvorak mode on the kinesis keyboard, and only map the numbers and
symbols using software.
